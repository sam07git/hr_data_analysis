## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains anonymized HR data of employees, including:
- Employee demographics (Age, Gender, Education, etc.)
- Job-related details (Department, Job Role, Job Level, etc.)
- Performance & satisfaction metrics (Job Satisfaction, Environment Satisfaction, Work-Life Balance)

## 📌 Project Workflow

### ✅ 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed constant columns: `EmployeeCount`, `Over18`, `StandardHours`
- Checked for missing values and duplicates
- Ensured data consistency

### 🔍 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- General statistics and structure
- Attrition rate analysis
- Grouped insights by department, gender, job role, and more

### 📊 3. Data Visualization
- Attrition rate (Pie chart)
- Department-wise attrition (Bar plot)
- Age vs Attrition (Histogram)
- Monthly Income distribution
- Overtime, Job Role, and Work-Life Balance impact on attrition
- Correlation heatmap for numeric features

### 📈 4. Key Insights
- Employees with overtime and poor work-life balance tend to leave more
- Certain roles and departments show higher attrition
- Younger and lower-paid employees are more likely to leave
- Job satisfaction and environment satisfaction impact retention
